Well, I started out down a dirty road<br/>
Started out all alone<br/>
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill<br/>
And the town lit up, the world got still<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings <br/>
Coming down is the hardest thing<br/>
<br/>
Well, the good old days may not return<br/>
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)<br/>
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)<br/>
Coming down (Learning to fly)<br/>
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)<br/>
<br/>
Well, some say life will beat you down<br/>
Break your heart, steal your crown<br/>
So I've started out for God knows where<br/>
I guess I'll know when I get there<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning to fly around the clouds<br/>
But what goes up (Learning to fly)<br/>
Must come down<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)<br/>
But I ain't got wings<br/>
Coming down is the hardest thing<br/>
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)<br/>
Around the clouds<br/>
But what goes up (Learning to fly)<br/>
Must come down<br/>
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)<br/>
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)<br/>
(Learning to fly, learning to fly)
