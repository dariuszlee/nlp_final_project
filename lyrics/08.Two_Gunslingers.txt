Two gunslingers walked out in the street and one said<br/>
"I don't wanna fight no more."<br/>
And the other gunslinger thought about it and said,<br/>
"Yeh, what are we fighting for?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm takin' control of my life, I'm takin' control of my life<br/>
I'm takin' control of my life right now, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
Well the crowd that assembled for the gun fight<br/>
Were let down, everyone hissed and booed<br/>
And a stranger told his Mrs., "That's the last one of those gunfights<br/>
You're ever gonna drag me to."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well the two gunslingers went ridin' out of town and<br/>
Were never heard from no more<br/>
And there ain't been a gunfight for a long time<br/>
Maybe never, but nobody knows for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
