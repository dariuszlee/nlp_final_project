Tonight we ride, right or wrong<br/>
Tonight we sail, on a radio song<br/>
Rescue me, should I go down<br/>
If I stay too long in trouble town<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby<br/>
You break me in two<br/>
But you move me, honey<br/>
Yes, you do<br/>
<br/>
Now and again I get the feeling<br/>
Well if I don't win, I'm a gonna break even<br/>
Rescue me, should I go wrong<br/>
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby<br/>
You break me in two<br/>
But you move me, honey<br/>
Yes, you do<br/>
<br/>
I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants<br/>
You be the girl at the high school dance<br/>
Run with me, wherever I go<br/>
Just play dumb, whatever you know<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby<br/>
You break me in two<br/>
But you move me, honey<br/>
Yes, you do
