There was a girl I knew<br/>
She said she cared about me<br/>
She tried to make my world<br/>
The way she thought it should be<br/>
Yeah we were desperate then<br/>
To have each other to hold<br/>
But love is a long, long road<br/>
<br/>
There were so many times<br/>
I would wake up at noon<br/>
With my head spinning 'round<br/>
I would wait for the moon<br/>
And give her one more chance<br/>
To try and save my soul<br/>
But love is a long, long road<br/>
<br/>
Yeah it was hard to give up<br/>
Some things are hard to let go<br/>
Some things are never enough<br/>
I guess I only can hope<br/>
For maybe one more chance<br/>
To try and save my soul<br/>
But love is a long, long road
