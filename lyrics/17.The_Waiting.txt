Oh baby don't it feel like heaven right now<br/>
Don't it feel like something from a dream<br/>
Yeah I've never known nothing quite like this<br/>
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again<br/>
We know better than to try and pretend<br/>
Baby no one could'a ever told me 'bout this<br/>
I said yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The waiting is the hardest part<br/>
Every day you see one more card<br/>
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart<br/>
The waiting is the hardest part<br/>
<br/>
Well yeah i might have chased a couple women around<br/>
All it ever got me was down<br/>
Then there were those that made me feel good<br/>
But never as good as I'm feeling right now<br/>
Baby you're the only one that's ever known how<br/>
To make me wanna live like I wanna live now<br/>
I said yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The waiting is the hardest part<br/>
Every day you get one more yard<br/>
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart<br/>
The waiting is the hardest part<br/>
<br/>
Oh don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you<br/>
Don't let it kill you baby, don't let it get to you<br/>
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool<br/>
Don't let this go too far<br/>
Don't let it get to you
