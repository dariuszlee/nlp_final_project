When the time gets right<br/>
I'm gonna pick you up<br/>
And take you far way from trouble my love<br/>
Under big ol' sky<br/>
Out in the field of green<br/>
There's gotta be something left for us to believe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Oh, I await the day<br/>
Good fortune comes our way<br/>
And we ride down the Kings Highway<br/>
<br/>
No you can't hide out<br/>
In a six gun town<br/>
We wanna hold our heads up, but we gotta stay down<br/>
I don't wanna end up<br/>
In room all alone<br/>
Don't wann end up someone that I don't even know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>

<br/><br/>
