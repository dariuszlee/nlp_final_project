When I was a young boy<br/>
I was workin' for the state<br/>
I wasn't makin' much money<br/>
I was stayin' out late<br/>
Go down at nighttime and<br/>
Play music in the bars<br/>
Take my breaks out underneath the stars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I was makin' some noise<br/>
I was a workin' boy up at the top of my voice<br/>
Sayin', "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"<br/>
<br/>
I had to rock  the boat, I had to shake the tree<br/>
To see what'd fall down on me<br/>
I thought, "Maybe I can make it if I never give in<br/>
I been down before, I ain't goin' down again."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
From across the canyon a guitar plays<br/>
Through an amplifier on long delay<br/>
It was an old melody, I recognized the song<br/>
I had an amplifier too, so I played along<br/>
<br/>
I'm makin' some noise, I'm still a working boy<br/>
Up at the top of my voice<br/>
Sayin', "Look at me Mama I'm makin' some noise."<br/>
I'm makin' some noise, I been a long gone boy
