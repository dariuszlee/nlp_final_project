She grew up in an Indiana town<br/>
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around<br/>
But she grew up tall and she grew up right<br/>
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights<br/>
<br/>
Well, she moved down here the age of eighteen<br/>
She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen<br/>
I was introduced and we both started groovin'<br/>
She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on<br/>
Keep movin' on"<br/>
<br/>
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain<br/>
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don't know, but I've been told<br/>
You never slow down, you never grow old<br/>
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down<br/>
Tired of myself, tired of this town<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my my, oh, hell yes<br/>
Honey, put on that party dress<br/>
Buy me a drink, sing me a song<br/>
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long<br/>
<br/>
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain<br/>
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again<br/>
<br/>
There's pigeons down on Market Square<br/>
She's standin' in her underwear<br/>
Lookin' down from a hotel room<br/>
The nightfall will be comin' soon<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my my, oh, hell yes.<br/>
You got to put on that party dress<br/>
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone<br/>
I hit my last number, I walked to the road<br/>
<br/>
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain<br/>
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again
