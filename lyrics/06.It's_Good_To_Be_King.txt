It's good to be king, if just for a while<br/>
To be there in velvet, yeah, to give 'em a smile<br/>
It's good to get high and never come down<br/>
It's good to be king of your own little town<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the world would swing if I were king<br/>
Can I help it if I still dream time to time<br/>
<br/>
It's good to be king and have your own way<br/>
Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day<br/>
And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings<br/>
You're out there with winners, it's good to be king<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I'll be king when dogs get wings<br/>
Can I help it if I still dream time to time<br/>
<br/>
It's good to be king and have your own world<br/>
It helps to make friends, it's good to meet girls<br/>
A sweet little queen who can't run away<br/>
It's good to be king, whatever it pays<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me if I have some place in my mind<br/>
Where I go time to time
