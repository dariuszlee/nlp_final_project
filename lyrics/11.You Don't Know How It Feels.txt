Let me run with you tonight<br/>
I'll take you on a moonlight ride<br/>
There's someone I used to see<br/>
But she don't give a damn for me<br/>
<br/>
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint<br/>
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud<br/>
You don't know how it feels<br/>
You don't know how it feels to be me<br/>
<br/>
People come, people go<br/>
Some grow young, some grow cold<br/>
I woke up in between<br/>
A memory and a dream<br/>
<br/>
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint<br/>
Let's head on down the road<br/>
There's somewhere I gotta go<br/>
And you don't know how it feels<br/>
You don't know how it feels to be me<br/>
<br/>
My old man was born to rock<br/>
He's still tryin' to beat the clock<br/>
Think of me what you will<br/>
I've got a little space to fill<br/>
<br/>
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint<br/>
And let's head on down the road<br/>
There's somewhere I got to go<br/>
And you don't know how it feels<br/>
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
