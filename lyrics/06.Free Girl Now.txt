I remember when you were his dog<br/>
I remember you under his thumb<br/>
Yeah baby, when he would call<br/>
Every time, you had to come<br/>
<br/>
Hey, baby, you're a free girl now<br/>
Hey, baby, you're a free girl now<br/>
<br/>
I remember when he was your boss<br/>
I remember him touching your butt<br/>
I remember you counting your blessings<br/>
Yeah honey, you had to keep your mouth shut<br/>
<br/>
Hey baby, you're a free girl now<br/>
Yeah baby, you're a free girl now<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well all right<br/>
Honey, put your sugar down<br/>
Dazzle, dazzle the moon above<br/>
Lay your victim down<br/>
<br/>
No longer will you be a slave<br/>
No longer will you have to crawl<br/>
No longer will you suffer<br/>
No longer will you stall<br/>
One day you'll live for a reason<br/>
One day you'll be gone, no more<br/>
When you walk from the table<br/>
No longer, will you bow down<br/>
<br/>
Hey baby, you're a free girl now<br/>
Hey baby, you're a free girl now
