I was talking with a friend of mine, said a woman had hurt his pride<br/>
Told him that she loved him so and turned around and let him go<br/>
Then he said, "You better watch your step<br/>
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself<br/>
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size"<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
What if I love you baby?<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Someday I might need you, baby<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
<br/>
Listen honey, can you see? Baby, it would bury me<br/>
If you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try<br/>
And you know you better watch your step<br/>
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself<br/>
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
What if I love you baby?<br/>
Don't, don't, don't, don't<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
What if I need you baby?<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
<br/>
'Cause somewhere deep down inside<br/>
Someone is saying, "Love doesn't last that long"<br/>
I've had this feelin' inside night and day in<br/>
And baby I can't take it no more<br/>
<br/>
Listen honey, can you see? Baby, it would bury me<br/>
If you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try<br/>
And you know you better watch your step<br/>
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself<br/>
Someone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
What if I love you baby?<br/>
Don't, don't, don't, don't<br/>
<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
I just might need you honey<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
<br/>
Wait!<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Baby, baby, baby,<br/>
Don't, don't, don't<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Don't do me like that<br/>
Baby, baby, baby...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh
