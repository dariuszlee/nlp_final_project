We gotta get to a higher place<br/>
And we gotta leave by night<br/>
Before that river takes us down<br/>
We gotta find some place that's dry<br/>
We gotta run like we've never run<br/>
Or we're gonna lose the light<br/>
<br/>
If we don't get to a higher place and find somebody<br/>
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more<br/>
<br/>
Well, I fool myself and I don't know why<br/>
I thought we could ride this out<br/>
I was up all night making up my mind<br/>
But now I've got my doubts<br/>
I got my eye on the waterline<br/>
Trying to keep my sense of humor<br/>
<br/>
But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody<br/>
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more<br/>
<br/>
We gotta get to a higher place<br/>
And I hope we all arrive together<br/>
We gotta get to a higher place<br/>
If we want to survive the weather<br/>
<br/>
I remember walking with her in town<br/>
Her hair was in the wind<br/>
I gave her my best kiss<br/>
She gave it back again<br/>
When I add up what I've left behind<br/>
I don't want to lose no more<br/>
<br/>
But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody<br/>
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more
