Don't come around here no more<br/>
Don't come around here no more<br/>
Whatever you're looking for<br/>
Hey! don't come around here no more<br/>
<br/>
I've given up, I've given up<br/>
I've given up on waiting any longer<br/>
I've given up, on this love getting stronger<br/>
<br/>
I don't feel you any more<br/>
you darken my door<br/>
Whatever you're looking for<br/>
Hey! don't come around here no more<br/>
<br/>
I've given up, I've given up<br/>
I've given up, you tangle my emotions<br/>
I've given up, honey please admit it is over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stop walking down my street<br/>
Who do you expect to meet?<br/>
Whatever you're looking for<br/>
Hey! don't come around here no more
