You think you're gonna take her away<br/>
With your money and your cocaine<br/>
Keep thinkin' that her mind is gonna change<br/>
But I know everything is okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She's gonna listen to her heart<br/>
It's gonna tell her what to do<br/>
Well, she might need a lot of lovin'<br/>
But she don't need you<br/>
<br/>
You want me to think that I'm being used<br/>
You want her to think it's over<br/>
Can't you see it don't matter what you do<br/>
Buddy you don't even know her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
And you just can't creep up behind her<br/>
And you can't understand that she's my girl<br/>
She's my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
