You better watch what you say<br/>
You better watch what you do to me<br/>
Don't get carried away<br/>
Girl, if you can do better than me, go<br/>
Yeah go, but remember<br/>
<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
When I found you<br/>
<br/>
You put a hand on my cheek<br/>
And then you turn your eyes away<br/>
If you don't feel complete<br/>
If I don't take you all of the way, then go<br/>
Yeah go, but remember<br/>
<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
When I found you<br/>
<br/>
Yeah go, just go, but remember<br/>
<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
Good love is hard to find<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
You got lucky babe<br/>
I found you
