It's alright if you love me<br/>
It's alright if you don't<br/>
I'm not afraid of you running away<br/>
Honey, I get the feeling you won't<br/>
<br/>
There is no sense in pretending<br/>
Your eyes give you away<br/>
Something inside you is feeling like I do<br/>
We said all there is to say<br/>
<br/>
Baby Breakdown<br/>
Go ahead and give it to me<br/>
Breakdown honey take me through the night<br/>
Breakdown now I'm standing here can't you see<br/>
Breakdown, it's alright<br/>
It's alright<br/>
It's alright<br/>
<br/>
Breakdown<br/>
Go ahead and give it to me<br/>
Breakdown honey take me through the night<br/>
Breakdown now I'm standing here can't you see<br/>
Breakdown, it's alright<br/>
It's alright<br/>
It's alright
