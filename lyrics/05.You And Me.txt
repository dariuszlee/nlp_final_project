Take a look<br/>
At what I got<br/>
I can't promise<br/>
You a lot<br/>
<br/>
But you and me<br/>
And the road ahead<br/>
<br/>
I can't save<br/>
You from yourself<br/>
You gotta want it<br/>
All that's left<br/>
<br/>
Is you and me<br/>
And the road ahead<br/>
<br/>
Wherever that wind might blow<br/>
Wherever that river rolls<br/>
You know I will go with you<br/>
<br/>
Lookin' over<br/>
The mountain's crown<br/>
The water roars<br/>
And tumbles down<br/>
<br/>
Like you and me<br/>
And the road ahead<br/>
<br/>
Wherever that wind might blow<br/>
Wherever that river rolls<br/>
You know I will go with you<br/>
<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
And the road ahead<br/>
<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
And the road ahead
