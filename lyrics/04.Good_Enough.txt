She was hell on her mama<br/>
Impossible to please<br/>
She wore out her daddy<br/>
Got the best of me<br/>
<br/>
And there's somethin' about her<br/>
That only I can see<br/>
And that's good enough<br/>
<br/>
You're barefoot in the grass<br/>
And you're chewin' sugarcane<br/>
You got a little buzz on<br/>
You're kissin' in the rain<br/>
<br/>
And if a day like this<br/>
Don't ever come again<br/>
<br/>
Well that's good enough<br/>
Good enough for me<br/>
Good enough for right now<br/>
Good enough for me<br/>
Good enough for right now<br/>
<br/>
God bless this land<br/>
God bless this whiskey<br/>
I can't trust love<br/>
It's far too risky<br/>
<br/>
If she marries into money<br/>
She's still gonna miss me<br/>
And that's good enough<br/>
Gonna have to be good enough
