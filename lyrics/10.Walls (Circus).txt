Some days are diamonds<br/>
Some days are rocks<br/>
Some doors are open<br/>
Some roads are blocked<br/>
<br/>
Sundowns are golden<br/>
Then fade away<br/>
But if I never do nothing<br/>
I'll get you back some day, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You got a heart so big<br/>
It could crush this town<br/>
And I can't hold out forever<br/>
Even walls fall down<br/>
<br/>
All around your island<br/>
There's a barricade<br/>
That keeps out the danger<br/>
That holds in the pain<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you're happy<br/>
Sometimes you cry<br/>
Half of me is ocean<br/>
Half of me is sky, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some things are over<br/>
Some things go on<br/>
Part of me you carry<br/>
Part of me is gone, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
