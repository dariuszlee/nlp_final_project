There's some friends that I know<br/>
Living in this town and I've come far to see them.<br/>
Gonna track em' down.<br/>
They live in a brick house painted white and brown.<br/>
<br/>
Left a tip for the maid and I packed up my guitar,<br/>
Dropped my key on the counter, rented a car.<br/>
Gonna hook up with em' later and go hit the bars.<br/>
<br/>
I need a big weekend. Kick up the dust.<br/>
Yeah a big weekend.<br/>
If you don't run, you rust.<br/>
<br/>
Well I may shake your hand but I won't know your name.<br/>
The joke in your language don't come out the same.<br/>
There's times when I'm down and there's nothing to blame.<br/>
<br/>
I need a big weekend.<br/>
Kick up the dust.<br/>
Yeah a big weekend.<br/>
If you don't run, you rust.<br/>
<br/>
I can work, I can travel, sleep anywhere,<br/>
Cross every border with nothing to declare.<br/>
You can look back babe, but it's best not to stare.<br/>
<br/>
I need a big weekend.<br/>
Kick up the dust.<br/>
Yeah a big weekend.<br/>
If you don't run, you rust.
