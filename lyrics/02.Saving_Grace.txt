I'm passing sleeping cities<br/>
Fading by degrees<br/>
Not believing all I see to be so<br/>
<br/>
I'm flyin' over backyards<br/>
Country homes and ranches<br/>
Watching life between the branches below<br/>
<br/>
And it's hard to say<br/>
Who you are these days<br/>
But you run on anyway<br/>
Don't you baby?<br/>
<br/>
You keep running for another place<br/>
To find that saving grace<br/>
<br/>
I'm moving on alone over ground that no one owns<br/>
Past statues that atone for my sins<br/>
There's a guard on every door<br/>
And a drink on every floor<br/>
Overflowing with a thousand amens<br/>
<br/>
And it's hard to say<br/>
Who you are these days<br/>
But you run on anyway<br/>
Don't you baby?<br/>
<br/>
You keep running for another place<br/>
To find that saving grace<br/>
Don't you baby?<br/>
<br/>
You're rolling up the carpet<br/>
Of your father's two-room mansion<br/>
No headroom for expansion no more<br/>
And there's a corner of the floor<br/>
They're telling you is yours<br/>
You're confident but not really sure<br/>
<br/>
And it's hard to say<br/>
Who you are these days<br/>
But you run on anyway<br/>
Don't you baby?<br/>
<br/>
You keep running for another place<br/>
To find that saving grace<br/>
<br/>
Don't you baby?<br/>
<br/>
You keep running for another place<br/>
To find that saving grace<br/>
<br/>
Don't you baby?
