Well talk on the street<br/>
Says you might go solo<br/>
A good friend of mine<br/>
saw you leavin' by your back door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I need to know, I need to know<br/>
If you think you're gotta leave<br/>
Then you better say so<br/>
I need to know, I need to know<br/>
Cause I don't know how long I can hold on<br/>
If you're making me wait, if you're leadin' me on<br/>
I need to know<br/>
<br/>
Who would've thought that<br/>
You'd fall for his line<br/>
All of a sudden<br/>
It's me on the outside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I need to know<br/>
I need to know<br/>
Baby, I need to know

<br/><br/>
