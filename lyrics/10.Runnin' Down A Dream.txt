It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down<br/>
I had the radio on, I was drivin'<br/>
Trees went by, me and Del were singin'<br/>
Little Runaway<br/>
I was flyin'<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, runnin' down a dream<br/>
That never would come to me<br/>
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads<br/>
Runnin' down a dream<br/>
<br/>
I felt so good, like anything was possible<br/>
Hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes<br/>
The last three days the rain was unstoppable<br/>
It was always cold, no sunshine<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, runnin' down a dream<br/>
That never would come to me<br/>
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads<br/>
Runnin' down a dream<br/>
<br/>
I rolled on, the sky grew dark<br/>
I put the pedal down to make some time<br/>
There's something good waitin' down this road<br/>
I'm pickin' up whatever's mine<br/>
<br/>
I'm runnin' down a dream<br/>
That never would come to me<br/>
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads<br/>
Runnin' down a dream<br/>
Yeah, I'm runnin' down a dream<br/>
That never would come to me<br/>
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads<br/>
I'm runnin' down a dream
