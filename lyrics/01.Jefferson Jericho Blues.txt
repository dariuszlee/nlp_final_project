Well poor Tom Jefferson<br/>
He loved the little maid out back<br/>
Midnight creepin' out to the servant's shack<br/>
Kept a secret under the bed<br/>
Wrapped in a burlap sack<br/>
Well I drove all day and night<br/>
Out to Jericho<br/>
But in my second mind<br/>
<br/>
I knew it was time to go<br/>
Yeah and I still get nervous every time<br/>
That bugle blows<br/>
Well she ain't no good for me<br/>
But I just can't let go<br/>
If I sit here thinkin'<br/>
My thoughts will overflow<br/>
And I can't keep from cryin'<br/>
Can't keep time from movin' slow
