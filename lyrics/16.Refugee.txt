We got somethin', we both know it, we don't talk too much about it<br/>
Ain't no real big secret, all the same, somehow we get around it<br/>
Listen, it don't really matter to me baby<br/>
You believe what you want to believe, you see<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some<br/>
Tell me why you want to lay there, revel in your abandon<br/>
Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby<br/>
Everybody's had to fight to be free, you see<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)<br/>
No baby you don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)<br/>
<br/>
Baby we ain't the first<br/>
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned<br/>
Right now this seems real to you, but it's<br/>
One of those things you gotta feel to be true<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have kicked you around some<br/>
Who knows maybe you were kidnapped, tied up<br/>
Taken away and held for ransom<br/>
Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby<br/>
Everybody's had to fight to be free, you see<br/>
<br/>
Don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)<br/>
No you don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)<br/>
You don't have to live like a refugee<br/>
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
