Well you can't turn him into a company man<br/>
You can't turn him into a whore<br/>
And the boys upstairs just don't understand anymore<br/>
Well the top brass don't like him talking so much<br/>
And he won't play what they say to play<br/>
And he don't want to change what don't need to change<br/>
And there goes the last DJ<br/>
Who plays what he wants to play<br/>
And says what he wants to say<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
And there goes your freedom of choice<br/>
There goes the last human voice<br/>
There goes the last DJ<br/>
Well some folks say they're gonna hang him so high<br/>
Because you just can't do what he did<br/>
There's some things you just can't put in the minds of those kids<br/>
As we celebrate mediocrity all the boys upstairs want to see<br/>
How much you'll pay for what you used to get for free<br/>
And there goes the last DJ<br/>
Who plays what he wants to play<br/>
And says what he wants to say<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
And there goes your freedom of choice<br/>
There goes the last human voice<br/>
And there goes the last DJ<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental break]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well he got him a station down in Mexico<br/>
And sometimes it will kinda come in<br/>
And I'll bust a move and remember how it was back then<br/>
There goes the last DJ<br/>
Who plays what he wants to play<br/>
And says what he wants to say<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
And there goes your freedom of choice<br/>
There goes the last human voice<br/>
And there goes the last DJ
