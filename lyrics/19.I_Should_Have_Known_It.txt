I shoulda known it<br/>
I shoulda seen<br/>
Leave it to you<br/>
To treat me mean<br/>
<br/>
Every promise was just a runaround<br/>
I shoulda known it<br/>
Yeah you're gonna let me down<br/>
Well it's over now you see<br/>
It's the last time you're gonna hurt me<br/>
<br/>
I shoulda known it<br/>
Hard to believe<br/>
It was all right there<br/>
In front of me<br/>
<br/>
Sold down the river<br/>
Left for dead<br/>
Yeah you're puttin' ideas<br/>
In another man's head<br/>
<br/>
And it's over now you see<br/>
It's the last time you're gonna hurt me<br/>
Thanks for nothin'<br/>
Yeah thanks a lot<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead baby<br/>
Take all I got<br/>
And it's over now ya see<br/>
It's the last time you're gonna hurt me<br/>
It's the last time you're gonna hurt me
