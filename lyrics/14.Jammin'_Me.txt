You got me in a corner<br/>
You got me against the wall<br/>
I got nowhere to go<br/>
I got nowhere to fall<br/>
<br/>
Take back your insurance<br/>
Baby nothin's guaranteed<br/>
Take back your acid rain<br/>
Let your T.V. bleed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're jammin' me, you're jammin' me,<br/>
Quit jammin' me<br/>
Baby you can keep me painted in a corner<br/>
You can walk away, but it's not over<br/>
<br/>
Take back your angry slander<br/>
Take back your pension plan<br/>
Take bakc your ups and downs of your life<br/>
In raisin-land<br/>
<br/>
Take back Vanessa Redgrave<br/>
Take back Joe Piscopo<br/>
Take back Eddie Murphy<br/>
Give 'em all some place to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Take back your iranian torture<br/>
And the apple in young Steve's eye<br/>
Yeah take back your losing streak<br/>
Check your front wheel drive<br/>
<br/>
Take back Pasadena<br/>
Take back El Salvador<br/>
Take back that country club<br/>
They're tryin' to build outside my door

<br/><br/>
