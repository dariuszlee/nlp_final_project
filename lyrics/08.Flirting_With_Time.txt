A coyote ran across the road<br/>
On the move without a home.<br/>
A flash of light reminded me of you.<br/>
This could well be your last stand.<br/>
Hold the sunlight in your hand.<br/>
Spread your fingers, feel the sand fall through.<br/>
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're flirting with time baby<br/>
Flirting with time, but maybe,<br/>
Time baby, is catching up with you.<br/>
<br/>
Shadowmen talk a real good game.<br/>
Every punchline has your name.<br/>
You cried out and no one came to you.<br/>
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Should be more to learn from this.<br/>
Can't say I know what it is.<br/>
No difference tween a hit or miss,<br/>
It's true.<br/>
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
