There's a shadow on the moon tonight<br/>
I swear I see your face up there with the satellites<br/>
Looking down from outer space<br/>
Me, I'm drifting home again<br/>
Headlights in my eyes<br/>
Fighting sleep with windows down<br/>
Worn out from long goodbyes.<br/>
<br/>
Night driver drifting home again <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
You offered up no history when you blew into town<br/>
You remain a mystery, no information found I speed dial the judgment call<br/>
The near miss hits the ground<br/>
The new king hides behind the throne refusing to be crowned.<br/>
<br/>
Night driver drifting home again <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
High tide rumbles, pch<br/>
My tires losing track<br/>
Helicopter circling, wiping overhead<br/>
Now I sit and count the days and try to fill my time<br/>
There's a shadow on the moon tonight<br/>
The dollar gets a dime.<br/>
<br/>
Night driver drifting home again <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Home Again
