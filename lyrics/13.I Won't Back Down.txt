Well, I won't back down<br/>
No, I won't back down<br/>
You can stand me up at the gates of hell<br/>
But I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
No, I'll stand my ground<br/>
Won't be turned around<br/>
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down<br/>
Gonna stand my ground<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, baby<br/>
There ain't no easy way out<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, I<br/>
Will stand my ground<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know what's right<br/>
I got just one life<br/>
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around<br/>
But I'll stand my ground<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, baby<br/>
There ain't no easy way out<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, I<br/>
Will stand my ground<br/>
(I won't back down) And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, baby<br/>
There ain't no easy way out<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, I<br/>
Won't back down<br/>
<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, baby<br/>
There ain't no easy way out<br/>
(I won't back down) Hey, I<br/>
Will stand my ground<br/>
(I won't back down) And I won't back down<br/>
(I won't back down) No, I won't back down
