My sister got lucky, married a yuppie<br/>
Took him for all he was worth<br/>
Now she's a swinger dating a singer<br/>
I can't decide which is worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But not me baby, I've got you to save me<br/>
Oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had<br/>
In a world gone mad, yer so bad<br/>
<br/>
My sister's ex-husband can't get no lovin'<br/>
Walks around dog-faced and hurt<br/>
Now he's got nothin', head in the oven<br/>
I can't decide which is worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
