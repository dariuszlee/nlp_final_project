Eddie waited til he finished high school<br/>
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo<br/>
He met a girl out there with a tattoo too<br/>
The future was wide open<br/>
<br/>
They moved into a place they both could afford<br/>
He found a night club he could work at the door<br/>
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords<br/>
The sky was the limit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Into the great wide open<br/>
Under them skies of blue<br/>
Out in the great wide open<br/>
A rebel without a clue<br/>
<br/>
The papers said Ed always played from the heart<br/>
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart<br/>
They made a record and it went in the chart<br/>
The sky was the limit<br/>
<br/>
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle<br/>
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled<br/>
Their A&amp;R man said, "I don't hear a single."<br/>
The future was wide open<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
