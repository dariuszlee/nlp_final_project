I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I can see everything tonight<br/>
I got a room where everyone<br/>
Can have a drink and forget those things<br/>
That went wrong in their life<br/>
<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
And I ain't comin' down, I ain't comin' down<br/>
<br/>
I got someone who loves me tonight<br/>
I got over a thousand dollars in the bank<br/>
And I'm all right<br/>
Look deep in the eyes of love<br/>
Look deep in the eyes of love<br/>
And find out what you were looking for<br/>
<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could feel you tonight, little one<br/>
You're so far away<br/>
I wanna reach out and touch your heart<br/>
Yeah like they do in those things on TV, I love you<br/>
Please love me, I'm not so bad<br/>
And I love you so<br/>
<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
I got a room at the top of the world tonight<br/>
And I ain't comin' down, no I ain't comin' down<br/>
I ain't comin' down
